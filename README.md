## JavaScript Concepts Used

This project allowed me to practice several key JavaScript concepts:

* **Variables:** I used variables to store the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.
* **Functions:** Functions were essential for organizing the code and making it reusable. I created functions to:
    * Generate the computer's choice randomly.
    * Determine the winner of the game based on the player's and computer's choices.
    * Play a single round of the game.
    * Display the results in the console.
* **Control Flow:** I used `if/else if/else` statements to determine the winner of each round based on the different combinations of choices (rock, paper, or scissors).
* **Loops:** While loops were used to allow the player to play multiple rounds of the game until they decide to stop.
* **Input/Output:**  `prompt()` was used to get the player's choice, and `console.log()` was used to display the results and messages to the player in the console. 
* **Random Number Generation:** `Math.random()` was used to generate a random number for the computer's choice.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of these fundamental JavaScript concepts and apply them in a practical and fun way.
